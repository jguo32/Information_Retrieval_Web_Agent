ROGET'S THESARUS (1911 Edition)

'roget' contains the original text of the 1911 version of the thesaurus.

'roget.tokenized'  contains the words and phrases in Roget's thesaurus,
1911 edition, one-per-line and with extraneous material removed.
There are 1023 classes in the thesaurus, delimited by a line with
### [0-9]+[a]? ###  (e.g.  ### 431 ### or ### 108a ###). 

'roget.hist' contains a histogram of the words and phrases used
in the thesaurus.

One very simple method to use Roget's thesaurus for IR would be 
the following:

  for all words *w* in a query or document:

    1) find all classes *c_i* in the thesaurus in which *w* appears
    2) add all members of *c_i* to the document/query vector
         in which *w* appears, weighted with a small value (relative
         to the original words), with appropriate compensation for
         frequency of the word in the thesaurus.

There are clearly more sophisticated approaches you could pursue.
Please come see me if you are interested.

WORDNET

Wordnet is a hierarchical organization of concepts. An example
is given in the files wn.*, which may contain terms of more
recent vintage than contained in the 1911 version of the
thesaurus.
