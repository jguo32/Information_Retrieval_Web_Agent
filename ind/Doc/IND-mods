Modifications to IND
====================


Bugs reported/fixed in IND prerelease 0.1:
========================================

1.    "make NumRec" should be commented out in IND/Makefile
      and references to IND/NumRec and -lnumrec should be
      deleted from IND/Util/lstat/Makefile

2.    "-v" flag in tclass returns incorrect value, variance
      calculation turns out to be ghastly so forget

Bugs reported/fixed in IND prerelease 0.2:
========================================

1.    got "-R" option in tgen & ttest working again

Bugs fixed in IND release 1.0
=============================

1.    screwed up "-R" option again

2.    got subsetting and contexts working (or appears that way)

Bugs fixed in IND release 1.1
=============================

1.    made Eglib/Makefile so symyacc.c and symlex.c don't need
      to be yaccd and flexd in release version, 10/25/91

2.    changed egset.size from short to int, and deleted use
      of MAXVALS and shorts in add_egs(), so that maximum
      set size can be > 32K, 10/26/91

Bugs fixed in IND release 1.2
=============================

1.    ".all" files not sampled properly in mkbld
2.    "-t" and "-m" not passed from ttest to mktree
3.    cut-points refuse to work with < than 5 data points
      (really a useful feature, but should be changeable),
      removed this for now and an overhall of cutpoint
      algorithm is required.
4.    "add_egs()" bombed if there where too many unknowns,
      fixed the bug
5.    subtle memory problems with "tgen -C" may cause bombing
      and possible errors; fixed

Bugs fixed in IND release 1.3
=============================

1.    Changed "char  c" to "int c" in options processing
2.    "ttest -C" didn't work due to bugs in mkbld and
	"sample -p";  fixed; also got it going with use of seeds
3.    changed Makefiles so that recompilation only if
      stuff changed
4.    Updated manual slightly
5.    converted release to use "shar" - great stuff!!
6.    documented new "-Ax,04" option

Bugs fixed in IND release 2.0
=============================

1.    got the CART bug at last and rewrote the CART code
2.    major rewrite of the test routines, TREE.h, flags, added
      bit arrays, removed various annoying limitations on size
3.    changed xgraph (no longer supported) to gnuplot for handling
      reports on cut points (interactive growing with 'g' and 'x')
4.    installed a few new subsetting types
5.    cleaned up cuts points
6.    installed decision graphs - but removed from this release - be in 3.0
7.    changed around documentation and manual so only postscript is released
8.    fixed memory allocation bugs so all memory properly deallocated
9.    installed new splitting rules:  twoing and gain ratio
10.   made both CART pruning and pessimistic pruning work with utilities
11.   cleaned up the options interface and introduced verbose mode
      to allow reports on all options used
12.   added "style" options to mktree and ttest
13.   reinstalled data encoding ("enc") with online sampling in tgen and tclass
      so mkbld & sample no longer used 
14.   removed the Bayesian classifier stuff "/IND/Bayes" cause arkward
      to support, will include in a later release
15.   made the option trees stuff operate nicely by itself without
      hand-holding, see the -L option to tgen, now works great!
16.   cleaned up ALL the options interfaces to make them more
      user friendly
17    simplified the "context" handling and reduced its functionality

Bugs fixed in IND release 2.1
=============================

1.    installed C4.5 pruning 
2.    corrected and debugged the "-ii" and "-ir" codes, and for
	cut points,  now agrees with C4.5
3.    rationalized the stopping rules, see "tgen -s"
4.    cleaned up and simplified Bayesian cut-point handling
5.    installed Jon Oliver's graph stuff 
6.    cleaned up the Include files
