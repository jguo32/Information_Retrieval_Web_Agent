All documents have been TeXed with output to various
Postscript files.  If you can't handle the Postscript, for instance 
your European style laser writer doesn't like US letter format,
then contact us for appropriate replacement files.

    Parts of a roughly 8 hour course on decision trees:
	cont.ps   :  a note on counting tables
