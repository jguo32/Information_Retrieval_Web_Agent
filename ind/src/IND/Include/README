WARNING:
	To get "xsaber" working, all the "*.h" files are
	duplicated throughout the various directories.
	Therefore, whenever you modify any of these you
	must duplicate them elsewhere.   Why not use
	a link (e.g. "ln *.h /Eglib/*.h") you ask?
	Well I don't know how to get emacs to maintain
	links correctly, and xsaber seems to trouble with these.
