Major differences in usage between Versions 1.X and 2.X are as follows:
 *	enc & encsmpl must now be used to prepare data sets
 *    	mktree has styles with the "-s" option
Flip through the examples in Sect. 1.4 and 2.2 in the new manual.
Note also the additional documentation in the /Doc directory.

An installation guide appears in the manual.  While you should print
out the manual and other companion documents, if you just
want to install, then most of the information
is reproduced in the primary Makefile.
So check the Makefile for how to install.

If you obtained IND via a diskette or tape, then all directories 
are compressed in the distribution.
To uncompress run:
	make uncompress
This is not necessary if you obtained IND via a shar file.

The IND manual is in the directory "IND/Doc" in Postscript form.
This is in US letter format, and was created using LaTeX and dvi2ps.
The manual is completed by printing the "man" pages.
The IND "man" pages are in the directory "IND/Man/man1"
and a command for printing the lot appears there.  

Lots of other documentation exists in "IND/Doc" as well.

If you have trouble printing the Postscript files, then ask
for versions to be sent to you, explaining the problem.  


Good luck!
