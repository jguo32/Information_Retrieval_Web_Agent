TMS1:   SPARSE SVD VIA TRACE MINIMIZATION USING 2-CYCLIC MATRICES

	TMS1 IS A PROGRAM WRITTEN IN FORTRAN 77 DESIGNED TO FIND SEVERAL
        OF THE LARGEST EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS OF A REAL SYMMETRIC
	POSITIVE DEFINITE MATRIX B.  THE MATRIX B IS ASSUMED TO BE
        OF THE FORM
  
                 B =  [ALPHA*I  A ],   WHERE A IS NROW BY NCOL
                      [A'  ALPHA*I]    (NROW>>NCOL) AND SPARSE,
	
        AND ALPHA IS AN UPPER BOUND FOR THE LARGEST SINGULAR VALUE OF
        THE MATRIX A.  HENCE, THE SINGULAR TRIPLETS OF A ARE COMPUTED AS 
        THE EIGENPAIRS OF B.  IF SIGMA IS A SINGULAR VALUE OF THE MATRIX
        A, THEN (ALPHA+SIGMA) AND (ALPHA-SIGMA) ARE EIGENVALUES OF B.
        THE FIRST NROW COMPONENTS OF THE EIGENVECTORS CORRESPOND TO
        THE LEFT SINGULAR VECTORS OF A, AND THE LAST NCOL COMPONENTS OF THE
        EIGENVECTORS OF B CORRESPOND TO THE RIGHT SINGULAR VECTORS OF A.
        A SIMILAR IMPLEMENTATION IS DISCUSSED IN "MULTIPROCESSOR
        SPARSE SVD ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS", PH.D. THESIS BY M. BERRY,
        UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN, OCTOBER 1990.  THIS
        VERSION DOES NOT IMPLEMENT CHEBYSHEV ACCELERATION. THE CODE USES
        RITZ-SHIFTING TO ACCELERATE CONVERGENCE.

        THIS IS A PARALLEL METHOD WHICH PERMITS CONCURRENT ITERATIONS OF THE
        CLASSICAL CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD.  PARALLELIZATION DIRECTIVES
        SUCH AS THE C$DOACROSS FOR THE SEQUENT SYMMETRY MULTIPROCESSOR
        (SHARED MEMORY) PRECEDE LOOPS WHOSE ITERATIONS CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY
        SCHEDULED ACROSS PROCESSORS OF ANY PARALLEL MACHINE.  THESE
        DIRECTIVES WILL BE TREATED AS COMMENTS BY ANY OTHER MACHINE'S
        PRE-PROCESSOR, OF COURSE, AND ITERATIONS OF THE CORRESPONDING LOOPS
        WILL BE EXECUTED IN SEQUENTIAL FASHION.

	SPARSE MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION SUBROUTINES OPAT AND OPB
        MUST BE SUPPLIED BY THE USER.
	.
	THE CALLING SEQUENCE FOR OPAT IS
	.
	CALL OPAT(X,Y)
	.
        IF A IS AN NROW BY NCOL MATRIX, OPAT TAKES AN NROW-VECTOR, AND RETURNS
	THE NCOL-VECTOR Y = A'*X.  IN OUR TEST PROGRAM, TMS1, WE EMPLOY THE
	HARWELL-BOEING SPARSE MATRIX FORMAT FOR ACCESSING ELEMENTS OF 
        THE SPARSE MATRIX A AND ITS TRANSPOSE (A').  OTHER SPARSE
        MATRIX FORMATS CAN BE USED, OF COURSE.
	.
	THE CALLING SEQUENCE FOR OPB IS
	.
	CALL OPB(N,X,Y,SHIFT)
	OPB TAKES AN N-VECTOR X AND RETURNS THE N-VECTOR Y=D*X,
        WHERE D = [B-SHIFT*I], I IS THE NTH-ORDER IDENTITY MATRIX.
        ALPHA IS AN UPPER BOUND FOR THE LARGEST SINGULAR OF MATRIX A,
        HERE, N = NUMBER OF ROWS PLUS COLUMNS OF THE MATRIX A WHOSE
        SINGULAR TRIPLETS ARE SOUGHT.
	.
        IN ADDITION, TMS1 REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING USER-SUPPLIED PARAMETER
        FOR TEMPORARY ARRAY ALLOCATIONS.
        .
        USER-SUPPLIED PARAMETER FOR SUBROUTINES CGT and CGTS (BOTH
        CALLED BY TSVD1):
        .
        NCG             ... SHOULD BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE ORDER
                            OF MATRIX B {INTEGER}.
        .
        THE MAIN PROGRAM (TMS1) WILL READ THE FOLLOWING PARMS FROM THE INPUT
        FILE TMI5:
        .
        P               ... NUMBER OF SINGULAR TRIPLETS (LARGEST) {INTEGER}.
        S               ... INITIAL SUBSPACE DIMENSION {INTEGER}.
        JOB             ... RITZ-SHIFTING CONTROL(0=NO,1=YES) {INTEGER}.

                            PRECISION}.

        VEC             ... OUTPUT SINGULAR VECTORS? {BOOLEAN}.
        .
        SUBROUTINE TSVD1 IS PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO APPROXIMATE THE P-LARGEST
        SINGULAR TRIPLETS OF A.  USERS INTERESTED IN THE P-SMALLEST
        SINGULAR TRIPLETS VIA TRACE MINIMIZATION SHOULD USE SUBROUTINE
        TSVD2 (TMS2 SOURCE CODE).
        .
        EXPLICIT CALLS TO THE UNIX TIMER "DTIME" IS MADE IN THE TMS1 SOURCE.
        A CALL TO ANOTHER TIMING ROUTINE (DELTA CPU TIME) MADE BE NEEDED.
        EXPLICIT CALLS TO THE WALL-CLOCK TIMER "ELAPSE" ARE MADE IN
        THE MAIN PROGRAM (TMS1).  THIS SUBROUTINE MAY ALSO NEED MODIFICATION.
        .
        IF THE PARAMETER "VEC" (READ FROM TMI5) IS SET TO ".TRUE.",
        THE UNFORMATTED OUTPUT FILE TMO8 WILL CONTAIN THE APPROXIMATE
        SINGULAR VECTORS WRITTEN IN THE ORDER U[1], V[1], U[2], V[2],
        ..., U[KEM], V[KEM].  HERE U[I] AND V[I] DENOTE THE LEFT AND RIGHT
        SINGULAR VECTORS, RESPECTIVELY, CORRESPONDING TO THE I-TH
        APPROXIMATE SINGULAR VALUE.
