# This program does the same thing as tcp_client.pl but instead uses
# the classes defined in the LWP package.
#
# Example:
#
#    lwp_client.pl http://www.cs.jhu.edu
#
# Note: you must use a command line argument of http://some.web.address
#       or else the program will fail with error code 404 (document not
#       found).
