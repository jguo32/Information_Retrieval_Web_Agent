# Note: you must use a command line argument of http://some.web.address

#      to extract links from a TreeBuilder object you pass to the
#      &extract_links method an array containg the start tags of
#      the links you are looking for.
#
#      Example:
#
#          $html_tree->extract_links( "img" )
#
#      Returns all links of the form
#
#          <img src="../images/some_picture.gif">
#
#   (new URI::URL $link)->abs( $response->base )
#
#      used to convert a relative link (such as "~jkloss/index.html") into
#      a fully qualified link (such as "http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jkloss/")
#      which may be used by an HTTP::Request object. The method
#
#        $reponse->base 
#
#      returns the base URL of the $response object (an HTTP::Response).
#
#        (new URI::URL $link)->abs( $response->base )
#    
#      prepends this base to the current $link.

# garbage collector will not free memory due to circular references
# created in the parse tree).
