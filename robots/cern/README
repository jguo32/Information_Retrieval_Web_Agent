THIS PROGRAM FROM CERN RETRIEVES URLS IN A VARIETY OF FORMATS, INCLUDING:

    http
    ftp
    gopher

It is an instructive example of how non-http formats may be retrieved.


USAGE:   url_get [-bdhcl] [-o file] <url> [userid password]\n

FOR EXAMPLE:

  ./url_get http://cs.jhu.edu/~baruch/
  ./url_get ftp://ftp.cs.jhu.edu/pub/admissions/brochure.ps 
  ./url_get gopher://jhuniverse.hcf.jhu.edu:10005/11/.newslett/1995%20Housing%20Guide


OBSERVATION:

  Using the -d (debug) flag typically causes the program to dump core.


MORE DETAIL:


# syntax: url_get [-bdhc] <url>
#
# where -b means binary transfer when doing ftp transactions,
#       -h means keep the MIME header in HTTP 1.0 transactions (url_get
#          strips this by default). Header & data go to stdout.
#       -d means "debug" mode on HTTP transfers (HTTP MIME header goes
#          to stderr, body of document goes to stdout), or FTP transfers
#          (FTP replies from remote host go to stderr, data to stdout)
#       -c means tell the proxy server (if there is one) to refresh
#          its cache (thanks to Yoav Freund)
#
# return code: url_get returns 0 upon successful completion. If the
#              server returns an HTTP error, url_get returns one of
#              the following codes:
#
#              HTTP code:       url_get returns:
#              ---------        ---------------
#               400              1
#               401              2
#               402              3
#               403              4
#               404              5
#               500              6
#               501              7
#               502              8
#               503              9
