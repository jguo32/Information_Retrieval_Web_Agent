TO RUN CHECKBOT:

 - copy the program  'checkbot' to an empty directory

 - run the program with a url of your choice
   
     ./checkbot -verbose -url http://www.cs.jhu.edu/ 


   (you may leave out the -verbose mode, but it helps 
     you make sure things are OK initially)


 - use netscape to view    file:checkbot.html

         (the results of your checkbot search.
            It will take a few minutes for this
               file to form.)
