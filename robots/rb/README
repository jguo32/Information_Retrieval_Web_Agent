THIS ROBOT WAS WRITTEN BY RICHARD WICENTOWSKI 
   as part of his 600.466 final project in 1996.


To run:

    FIRST COPY THIS PROGRAM TO AN EMPTY DIRECTORY
        (it writes temporary queue files and logs
          in the current directory)

    THEN EXECUTE THE PROGRAM:

      ./resum96.prl

 
    IF YOU RE-RUN THE PROGRAM AFTER YOU HAVE QUEUE/LOG FILES
       in the current directory, you will be asked if you
       want to continue where the program was aborted last
       time.
