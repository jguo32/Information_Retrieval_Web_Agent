	<p>
	  Greetings! I'm Francis (Frank) Ferraro, a senior Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University.
	  My advisor is <a href="http://cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme" title="Benjamin Van Durme">Benjamin Van Durme</a>.
	</p>
	
	<!-- <p> -->
	<!-- 	My CV is available as a <a href="Ferraro_CV.pdf" title="Link to PDF of my CV">PDF</a>. -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	
	<p>
	  My <span id="ri">research</span> is focused on developing and evaluating probablistic models of complex events and situations.
	  In Summer 2015, I was an intern at Microsoft Research.
	  I've also done some work at the intersection of text and video, learning extended syntactic frames, and identifying and classifying referential language use. 
	  I began my research career with biomedical imaging and a little bit of complexity theory.

	<h4>Short Bio (suitable for talk abstracts)</h4>
	Frank Ferraro is a senior Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Benjamin Van Durme.
	His research focuses on computational event semantics, and unlabeled, structured probabilistic modeling over very large corpora.
	He has published on a number of cross-disciplinary basic and applied projects, and has papers in areas such as multimodal processing and information extraction, latent-variable syntactic methods and applications, and the induction and evaluation of frames and scripts.
	He holds a Bachelors in Computer Science, and Mathematics, from the University of Rochester.
	
	<h4>More Details</h4>
	  <p>I am originally from Niskayuna, NY, a suburb of Schenectady
	  which is about 30 minutes north of Albany. I went to <a href="http://www.niskayunaschools.org/" title="Niskayuna CSD">Niskayuna High School</a>, where, in addition
	  to my studies, I swam on the varsity team and played the viola
	  for the Orchestra and Chamber Strings ensemble. Some highlights include beating our cross-town rivals in the section championships, winning the state championships and performing as a guest at an <a href="http://www.esyo.org/" title="ESYO">Empire State Youth Orchestra</a> Playathon event. I got an opportunity to better my own skills and learn from professionals when, with my High School Orchestra, I performed with the <a href="http://www.schenectadysymphony.org/home.php" title="SSO">Schenectady Symphony Orchestra</a>.</p>
	  
	  <p>At the University of Rochester, I was a member of the varsity swim and dive team throughout all four years. Over those four years I swam with a lot of great people and built some great bonds. As a team, we were able to win the <a href="http://www.libertyleagueathletics.com/" title="Liberty League">Liberty League</a> Championship two times, compete against some of the best D3 athletes in the nation while still having a lot of fun at the <a href="http://www.uaa.rochester.edu/" title="UAA Website">University Athletic Associaion (UAA)</a> Championships (our primary, end-of-season championships).
	  </p>

	  </p>-->
	  
	<!-- <p>Though I've used up my NCAA eligibility, I still can continue to compete (USA Master's Swimming). While I'll probably do that eventually, I'm taking time to do more unstructured training. I'm looking toward triathlons and trying to get more into running (probably long distance: half and full marathons) and biking. I'm also learning how to build bikes. -->
