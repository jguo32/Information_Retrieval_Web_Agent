WORK IN PROGRESS Working papers
Uncertainty, Heuristics, and Modeling. (working title), with Laura Martignon. Entrepreneurial Overconfidence Revisited, with Sabrina Artinger. Psychologically Savvy Organizations Are Morally Healthy, with Lindsay Thompson, & Kathleen Day. Long-Term Project with Reza Kheirandish, How Do Managers Perceive and React to Investors' Perception of Risk in the Market? The general idea is to develop a formal framework that allows us to analyze irrationality, where behavioral solution concepts generate behavioral equilibria. This project is theoretical, focusing on the formal structure and modeling aspects of irrationality in financial markets, where less-than-rational managers make decisions under inefficient prices. Formal treatments of this real-world combination(s) are rare, if any. Prospect Collaboration Behavioral Finance and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI)
