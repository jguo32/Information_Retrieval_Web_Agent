## EMPLOYMENT ##   S-1 Open Connectome Project (http://openconnecto.me), 2011. Co-Authors: J. Vogelstein, J. Vogelstein, E. Perlman, M. Kazhdan, and M. Chuang. Provides community access to more than 50TB of connectome data. This includes high-resolution electromagnetic imaging of the mouse visual cortex and over 1000 magnetic resonance (functional and diffusion) scans of the human brain. openconnecto.me provides visualization and analytics through a variety of programmable Web services.

## EMPLOYMENT ##   S-2 The JHU Turbulence Database Cluster (http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu), 2007. Co-Authors: E. Perlman and the JHU Turbulence Research Group. This service provides community access to more that 30 terabytes of high-resolution turbulence simulations using C, MatLab, and Fortran interfaces. It has served more than 100 billion point query requests.
## EMPLOYMENT ##   S-3 The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Observatory Testbed, 2007. Co-Authors: E. Perlman, R. Murphy, B. Ball. This service integrates more than 15 model-generated and observational data sets from the Chesapeake Bay. It allows scientists to explore, compare, and correlate data from buoys, cruises, over-flight, satellites, shallowwater monitoring, and high-resolution hydrodynamic and water-quality models.

## EMPLOYMENT ##   S-4 The ext3cow file system (http://www.ext3cow.com), 2004. Co-Author: Z. Peterson. The ext3cow file system provides an open-source implementation of continuous file versioning and file system snapshot. ext3cow builds upon the popular ext3 file system--the base file system for most Linux distributions. Ext3cow provides a time-shifting interface that permits a real-time and continuous view of data in the past.
## EMPLOYMENT ##   Our release of ext3cow for the Linux 2.6 kernel was reported on both slashdot.org and on digg.com on May 2, 2007. This resulted in over 23,000 visits to the Website in a single day. The software has been downloaded over 2,000 times. The ext3cow mailing list for developers and users includes over 50 active members, and four programmers from the open-source community have contributed to its source. Additionally, research projects at UC Berkeley, Columbia, Utah, and UC Santa Cruz build on the versioning features of ext3cow and a startup uses ext3cow as the disk file system in an object-based storage device.
## EMPLOYMENT ##   S-5 In-Place Rsync, 2003. Co-Author: D. Rasch. In-Place Rsync is an open-source implementation of the rsync protocol for remote file synchronization suitable for resource-constrained devices and storage systems. It updates a file in the memory/storage it currently occupies, requiring no scratch space. It was originally intended for use on handhelds, cellphones, etc. In practice, it is used more often to synchronize large files, avoiding the I/O costs of maintaining two copies. The in-place feature has been merged into the rsync source code and, thus, is part of the standard Linux distribution and available on all platforms that support GNU tools.

## EDUCATION ##   S-6 The Aries Database Project (http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/~randal/aries/), 2002. The ARIES project is a semester-long team programming task for students in EN 600.416 Transaction Processing Systems. The project provides a simple runtime environment in which teams implement the Algorithms for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics (ARIES) protocol for transactions, write-ahead logging, and restart recovery. ARIES is the fundamental principle in logging and recovery for commercial systems such as IBM DB/2 and Microsoft's SQL server. The software is listed on C. Mohan's ARIES impact Webpage http://www.almaden.ibm.com/u/mohan/ARIES_Impact.html. The project has been used in undergraduate/graduate courses three times at Johns Hopkins by Randal Burns and in an undergraduate/graduate course at the University of Toronto. The free software has been downloaded over 50 times.

## EDUCATION ##   S-7 IBM TotalStorage SAN File System, 2002. Co-Authors: R. Rees, W. Hineman, D. Pease, D. Long, and J. Menon. The IBM TotalStorage SAN File System (SFS) is the centerpiece of IBM's TotalStorage family of data management products. SFS provide data sharing across Linux, Windows, and AIX operating systems using iSCSI and Fibre-Channel storage networks. Randal Burns served as the Chief Scientist of the research project at Almaden Research Center in San Jose, CA that led to SFS. SFS employed over 250 engineers at IBM in 2004 and has been deployed at CERN (Switzerland) and Price-Waterhouse-Coopers (USA).

## EDUCATION ##   Randal Burns
## EDUCATION ##   Adaptive Differencing adds differential backup--the ability to backup a file using a small description of the changes made to that file from a previous version--to IBM's Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM). This technology reduces network transfer and backup time by an order of magnitude, enabling backup over low-bandwidth links for mobile computers. TSM has been IBM's backup and restore solution for over fifteen years and runs on over 15 clients platforms and 5 servers platforms. More than 1,000,000 seats of Adaptive Differencing have been deployed.
